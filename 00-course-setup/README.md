# Getting Started with this course

We are very excited for you to start this course and see what you get inspired to build with Generative AI!

To make your time successful, we have created this page that outlines any setup steps, technical requirements, and how to get help when you need it.

## Setup Steps

To start taking this course, you will need to complete the following steps.

### 1. Fork this Repo

[Fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (ðŸŒŸ) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to find it and related repos easier.

### 2. Create a codespace

To avoid any dependency issues when running the code, we recommend running this course in a GitHub codespace.

This can be created by selecting the `Code` option on your forked version of this repo and selecting the **Codespaces** option.

### 3. Storing Your API Keys

Keeping your API keys safe and secure is important when building any type of application. We encourage you not to store any API keys directly in the code you are working with as committing those details to a public repository could result in unwanted costs and issues.

## How to Run locally on your computer

To run the code locally on your computer, you would need to have some version of [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

To then use the repository, you need to clone it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners
cd generative-ai-for-beginners
```

Now you have everything checked out and can start learning and work with the code.

### Installing miniconda (optional step)

There are advantages to installing  **[miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)** - it is rather lightweight installation that supports `conda` package manager for different Python **virtual environments**. `conda` makes it easy to install and switch between different Python versions and packages, and also to install packages that are not available via `pip`.

After you install miniconda, you need to clone the repository (if you haven't already done so) and create a virtual environment to be used for this course:

Before running the below step, ensure that you first have an *environment.yml* file. The *environment.yml* file is used to create a conda environment with the necessary dependencies and can look like so:

```yml
name: <environment-name>
channels:  
 - defaults
dependencies:  
- python=<python-version>  
- openai  
- python-dotenv
```

You can replace `<environment-name>` with the name of your conda environment, and `<python-version>` with the version of Python you want to use. Place your created *environment.yml* file in the *.devcontainer* folder of your repo.

Now that you've hopefully created a *environment.yml* file, you can create a conda environment with the following command:


```bash
conda env create --name ai4beg --file .devcontainer/environment.yml
conda activate ai4beg
```

Refer to this link on creating a [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) if you run into trouble.

### Using Visual Studio Code with Python Extension

Probably the best way to use the curriculum is to open it in [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) with [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

> **Note**: Once you clone and open the directory in VS Code, it will automatically suggest you to install Python extensions. You would also have to install miniconda as described above.

> **Note**: If VS Code suggests you to re-open the repository in container, you need to decline this to use local Python installation. 

### Using Jupyter in the Browser

You can also use Jupyter environment right from the browser on your own computer. Actually, both classical Jupyter and Jupyer Hub provide quite convenient development environment with auto-completion, code highlighting, etc.

To start Jupyter locally, go to the directory of the course, and execute:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or

```bash
jupyterhub
```

You then can navigate to any of the `.ipynb` files, open them and start working.

### Running in container

An alternative to Python installation would be to run the code in container. Since our repository contains special `.devcontainer` folder that instructs how to build a container for this repo, VS Code would offer you to re-open the code in container. This will require Docker installation, and also would be more complex, so we recommend this to more experienced users.

One of the best ways to keep your API keys secure when using GitHub Codespaces is by using Codespace Secrets. Please follow this guide on how to [manage secrets for your codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-secrets-for-your-codespaces?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

## Lessons and Technical Requirements

The course has 6 concept lessons and 6 coding lessons.

For the coding lessons, we are using the Azure OpenAI Service. You will need access to the Azure OpenAI service and an API key to run this code. You can apply to get access by [completing this application](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

While you wait for your application to be processed, each coding lesson also includes a `README.md` file where you can view the code and outputs.

## Using the Azure OpenAI Service for the First Time

If this is your first time working with the Azure OpenAI service, please follow this guide on how to [create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

## Using the OpenAI API for the First Time

If this is your first time working with the OpenAI API, please follow the guide on how to [create and use the Interface.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=pythont&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

## Meet Other Learners

We have created channels in our official [AI Community Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) for meeting other learners. This is a great way to network with other like-minded entrepreneurs, builders, students, and anyone looking to level up in Generative AI.

[![Join discord channel](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://aka.ms/genai-discord?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

The project team will also be on this Discord server to help any learners.
